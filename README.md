starborn: statistical data visualization based on Vega and Altair
=================================================================

Starborn is a Python visualization library based on Altair that aims to be API-compatible with [Seaborn](seaborn.pydata.org). Like Seaborn, it provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. Thanks to the Vega library, it also offers interactivity: in-browser panning and zooming.
