starborn: statistical data visualization based on Vega and Altair
=================================================================

Starborn is a Python visualization library based on Vega and Altair that aims
to be API-compatible with [Seaborn](seaborn.pydata.org). Like Seaborn, it
provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
Thanks to the underlying libraries, it can also offer interactivity with
in-browser panning and zooming.
